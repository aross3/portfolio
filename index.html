    <h2 class="topiched">About me</h2>
    <p>I'm Allison, an investigative reporter and data journalist.</p>
    <p>I spent the last few years covering the state's largest school district at <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/" target="_blank">the Courier-Journal</a> in Louisville, Kentucky, and I'm now moving onto the company's investigative team. I formerly worked at The Palm Beach Post and at Bankrate.</p>
    <p>In addition to being a journo and data nerd, I'm an amateur baker just trying to make a successful sourdough bread.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Reporting on restraint and seclusion in schools</button>
      <div class="panel">
      <p>After hearing several anecdotes about students in schools being held down or confined to a room, I started pulling public records to understand the scope of the use of the practices. The first major finding: the state's largest school district had significantly underreported the number of times restraint and seclusion were being used - and it knew it had done so.</p>
	<p>Continued reporting uncovered the story of a boy who'd suffered two broken legs during a restraint, and stories of students who were bloodied or otherwise injured after questionable restraints. The work led to audits, multiple changes and even a proposed state takeover.</p>
