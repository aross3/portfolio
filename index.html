    <h2 class="topiched">About me</h2>
    <p>I'm Allison, an investigative reporter and data journalist.</p>
    <p>I spent the last few years covering the state's largest school district at <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/" target="_blank">the Courier-Journal</a> in Louisville, Kentucky, and I'm now moving onto the company's investigative team. I formerly worked at The Palm Beach Post and at Bankrate.</p>
    <p>In addition to being a journo and data nerd, I'm an amateur baker just trying to make a successful sourdough bread.</p>
