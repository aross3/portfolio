    <p><i>Sunday, September 11, 2011</i></p>
    <p><i>By ALLISON ROSS</i></p>


    <p>What they saw, they rarely speak of: pieces of airplanes and buildings and human beings, all
around them, pulverized into dust. People falling from the towers and landing right in front of
them, the impact so hard the bodies were gone, vaporized, just stains on the ground.
What they smelled, they can't describe: burning plastic, jet fuel, smoke, concrete dust,
decaying flesh.</p>
<p>If you were at ground zero, you knew that awful smell. It stuck to your clothes and skin and
coated your airways. If you weren't, Hernan Ramos said, "You can't even begin to describe it."
What they felt is just as hard to explain, even after 10 years. Post-traumatic stress has no end
date, no logic.</p>
<p>Tony Makowski knows he suffers from it. "I saw a lot of stuff you should never see."</p>
<p>Hans Austin cries when he remembers turning away desperate people holding photos of
missing relatives.</p>
<p>Frank Felicetti finds it hard to make eye contact when he talks of sifting through smoldering
debris and human remains with 5-pound plastic buckets.</p>
<p>"It was like Medusa touched everything," he said, "and the world turned to stone."</p>
<p>Most of the students who see Ramos and Felicetti and Makowski and Austin every day at their
schools can't even imagine what happened on 9/11. Some weren't even born.</p>
<p>Many don't know that their school police officers are among 20 or so former New York cops
who retired to Palm Beach County and now work for the school district.</p>
<p>Some came because they had family down here. Others, because they knew another school
officer.</p>
<p>And a few, because they just wanted to get away from New York. From all those memories.</p>
<p>If they talk about 9/11, they tend to use the dark humor of the survivor: retelling the story
about a police chief who mistakenly used a body bag as a raincoat; joking about how Jim used to
be 6-foot-4 before he got squashed under the rubble; swapping stories of waiting for the ice
cream truck or searching for Outback Steakhouse sandwiches during a break from working in
"the pit."</p>
<p>"If you don't laugh about it, you lose your mind," said Lou Bartolomeo, now an officer at Lake
Worth High.</p>
<p>Until a couple of weeks ago, however, they had never sat together and dug down deeper.
They had never really talked about the ghastly things, the wounds that even 10 years won't
heal.</p>
<p>Tony Makowski remembers he couldn't seem to run fast enough.</p>
<p>He couldn't seem to keep his feet under him.</p>
<p>As he headed toward the smoking north tower, people bumped him as they raced the other
way.</p>
<p>He kept stumbling, running, pushing against the crowd that was pressing in on him.</p>
<p>It wasn't until later that he realized why it seemed so hard for him to run -- he was tripping on
the shoes and briefcases and purses that people had abandoned as they fled.</p>
<p>They jettisoned all baggage that might slow them down, and the streets were littered with it.</p>
<p>Then Makowski heard an explosion and saw the south tower catch fire as the second plane hit.
Within an hour, it was Makowski's turn to run for cover.</p>
<P>"I didn't think it was possible to see the building come down," he said. "But then it did."</P>
<p>Racing down the street, he turned and jumped through the open back doors of the command
van parked a few blocks away. He watched as a wall of dust swallowed people up.</p>
<p>There was a thump, as someone, blinded by the dust, slammed into the back of the truck. They
opened the doors and grabbed him, pulling him into the van.</p>
<p>Soon, another thump, then another.</p>
<p>In the end, more than two dozen people, some covered in white dust head-to-toe, were
crammed into the van.</p>
<p>They listened as debris fell on the roof, as the driver tried over and over to get the engine to
turn over and catch so they could drive further away.</p>
<p>They didn't know what the world outside looked like, or what they would find when the dust
cleared. At one point, Tony heard the roar of planes overhead, and he felt an overwhelming sense
of panic and helplessness that more planes were attacking the city.</p>
<p>"My first thought is that they hijacked all the planes," Makowski said. "It wasn't until later that
I found out that I was hearing military planes."</p>
<p>They sat there, he's not sure how long, maybe 45 minutes, listening and hoping that nothing
would crush the van, hand-drawing maps and planning out a strategy for when the dust cleared. </p>
<p>He worried they'd need body bags, thousands of them.</p>
<p>But when he finally got out and got a chance to look around, he saw: Everything was dust.
Only seven bodies were recovered on the first day, said Hernan Ramos. He found the seventh
one.</p>
<p>He'd been working in a line of people shuttling away debris one bucket at a time. At the front
of the line, he saw the body, trapped underneath some beams.</p>
<p>"She lived in Long Island," he said. "I don't remember her name, but I remember that." </p>
<p>Ramos had seen a lot of bodies before, but not one like this. She had a backpack on, with ID in
it. What remained of her body was not much bigger than the backpack --- there were no longer
any bones.</p>
<p>Hans Austin was part of NYPD's missing-persons squad on 9/11.</p>
<p>After the towers fell, he was quickly shuffled to the morgue, where he expected to help
identify bodies.</p>
<p>Instead, he identified body parts. Once, they found only the skin from one finger -- nothing
else. One of the detectives placed the skin on his own finger, rolled it in ink and lifted out a
fingerprint.</p>
<p>"We were determined to identify everybody," said Austin, who worked in the morgue for
seven months. "Whatever we found, we tried to extract DNA out of it."</p>
<p>It broke his heart when grieving family members showed him photos of their loved ones and
begged him to find them. They couldn't understand the photos were no help.</p>
<p>"Working in the morgue ... it was one of the most traumatic experiences for me in the police
force," Austin said. He stopped, and began to cry.</p>
<p>"The hardest part was ... there were so many hard parts."</p>

<p>Frank Felicetti was getting coffee and an everything bagel with cream cheese when the first plane hit. At first, he thought a small plane had accidentally hit the building.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, he was drinking his coffee with his partner when the second plane flew
over them.</p>
<p>"I said to Pete, that guy is awfully low," Felicetti said. "Then we just heard the plane rev its
engine."</p>
<p>They watched as the second plane hit the south tower. They knew, then, that the first plane had
been no accident.</p>
<p>Felicetti managed to get home the night of Sept. 12.</p>
<p>He was covered in soot. He didn't want to go inside looking and smelling like he did, not with
his young son and 6-week-old daughter in the house.</p>
<p>He sat on the stoop for a little while, then undressed and jumped in the pool.</p>
<p>"That's when everything sort of settled in," he said.</p>
<p>Until then, he had just been moving, not thinking. But suddenly the rush of what he'd been
through flooded in.</p>
<p>The smells from the dust and the fire. The sight of twisted metal and lingering smoke. The
futile efforts to dig through the massive heap of debris with only 5-pound plastic buckets. The
shock of seeing the burned and charred jump seat from one of the planes lying in the street, the
bottom half of a man's body still strapped in.</p>
<p>How odd, he thought, how incongruous, that such a terrible thing could happen on such a
beautiful, sunny day.</p>

<p>Felicetti has learned to talk about 9/11 a little bit, through therapy. Talking doesn't stop the
nightmares, though.</p>
<p>Austin says he still breaks down, even after 10 years, whenever he tells stories from 9/11.</p>
<p>Ramos can't forget that smell, that bitter smell of ground zero.</p>
<p>Makowski decided to take a "transformational workshop" to set his life on a positive, new
course. That's when he realized he probably suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. "Most of
us probably do."</p>
<p>For the past few years, he's spoken to students on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. He
realized they needed to know how it really was, and he needed to share.</p>
<p>He is a living witness, like his colleagues.</p>
<p>"It's history," Makowski said. "Those who refuse to acknowledge history are doomed to repeat
it."</p>
<p>He keeps his tangible memories from 9/11 in a box -- photos of friends who died, thank-you
letters from children, cards from funerals. His fellow officers do, too.</p>
<p>But even after all this time, it's the intangible things they hold most tightly: what they saw,
what they smelled, what they felt.</p>

<p><h3><span style="color: #3D3A95">Former NYPD officers, now Palm Beach County school officers: 'It was 50-50 if you survived that day'</span></h3></p>

<p><b>Hernan Ramos</b></p>
<P><b>Then:</b> Sergeant with the Staten Island Task Force</P>
<p><b>Now:</b> Conniston Middle School police officer</p>
<p>Ramos worked for 36 straight hours after the planes hit the towers. Finally, exhausted, he lay
down to sleep for a couple hours. When he woke up, he thought he was still dreaming, or delirious -- sitting next to him were several young college girls, waiting to change his socks, give
him water and give him his first meal. "They came from New Jersey by boat. They just wanted
to help."</p>

<p><b>John Michaels</b></p>
<p><b>Then:</b> Undercover officer assigned to look for pickpocketers and scam artists</p>
<p><b>Now:</b> Police officer at South Intensive Transition alternative school</p>
<p>Michaels worked about a week straight at ground zero before he got a day off. He told his wife
that he wanted to do something normal with that day, so they went out to dinner. He sat there at
the restaurant, watching those around him eating, laughing, enjoying themselves. "I couldn't
understand how everyone was laughing. I couldn't deal with it. I had to get out of there."</p>

<p><b>Greg Cafaro</b></p>
<p><b>Then:</b> Sergeant, special operations division</p>
<p><b>Now:</b> Sergeant with the school police</p>
<p>Cafaro remembers how it seemed odd that there were no computers in the rubble. Nothing
whole -- just dust and paper. "It was 50-50 if you survived that day," Cafaro said. "If you went
left instead of right, if you went down the wrong alley ... those were the things that determined
whether you lived or died when the towers came down."</p>

<p><b>Frank Felicetti</b></p>
<p><b>Then:</b> Detective in the precinct closest to ground zero</p>
<p><b>Now:</b> With school police for six years, he works at the Adult Education Center</p>
<p>Felicetti was drinking coffee outside with his partner when the second plane flew over them.
"I said to Pete, that guy is awfully low," Felicetti said. "Then we just heard the plane rev its
engine."</p>

<p><b>Ezra Dilbert</b></p>
<p><b>Then:</b> Detective, emergency service unit</p>
<p><b>Now:</b>b With school police for six years, he is an investigator</p>
<p>Dilbert was in a helicopter, assigned to land on the roof of one of the towers and rescue
people. But the smoke was too thick for the helicopter to land, and as it circled away, Dilbert
watched as people, trapped and desperate, jumped from the windows.
Two years ago, his son came home with a history book; his class was learning about 9/11.
"My son just said, 'You're part of history.'</p>

<p><b>Tony Estrella</b></p>
<p><b>Then:</b> Officer in Staten Island</p>
<p><b>Now:</b> Glades Central High School police officer</p>
<p>Estrella was sleeping when the planes first hit; by the time he and his unit made it to ground
zero, both towers had fallen. "I stood there thinking, nothing could be worse than this."</p>

<p><b>Jim Schnaderbeck</b></p>
<p><b>Then:</b> Detective, narcotics</p>
<p><b>Now:</b> Okeeheelee Middle School police officer</p>
<p>Schnaderbeck worked in the landfill after 9/11, searching for body parts or any clue to victims'
identities. The ground at the landfill, he recalled, would bubble when it rained.</p>

<p><b>Tony Makowski</b></p>
<p><b>Then:</b> Officer with Manhattan South operations</p>
<p><b>Now:</b> With school police for seven years, he oversees several schools</p>
<p>Makowski ran for cover in his police van when the south tower collapsed. Dust was so thick,
other runners collided with the van -- hitting it each time with a thump --- and Makowski pulled
them inside.</p>

<p><b>Salvatore Longo</b></p>
<p><b>Then:</b> Officer on Staten Island</p>
<p><b>Now:</b> Emerald Cove Middle School police officer</p>
<p>Longo was on election duty on Staten Island when the first plane hit. When he made it near
ground zero, he was shocked by what he saw: Silent streets, covered in white dust. "It was
surreal," he said. "That's the only word I can think of."</p>

<p><b>Lou Bartolomeo</b></p>
<p><b>Then:</b> Detective</p>
<p><b>Now:</b> Lake Worth High School police officer</p>
<p>On his first day working the landfill at ground zero, Bartolomeo was assigned to "a pile of
dirt." As he got closer, he saw a human foot sticking out of the rubble, and the ground strewn
with IDs and credit cards. "You don't realize what you see," he said, "until much later."</p>

<p><b>Kevin O'Sullivan</b></p>
<p><b>Then:</b> Lieutenant in Manhattan</p>
<p><b>Now:</b> Inlet Grove High School police officer</p>
<p>O'Sullivan's 9/11 experiences were one reason he left New York when he retired. "I felt these
terrorists were going to come back, and I didn't want to be there and have to experience that."</p>

<p><b>Kevin Kenny</b></p>
<p><b>Then:</b> Police officer in Queens</p>
<p><b>Now:</b> Jeaga Middle School police officer</p>
<p>Kenny remembers how hot the pile of rubble was when he arrived on scene ... so hot it burned
the soles of your shoes. He remembers how they set up a makeshift morgue at a nearby Brooks
Brothers store. Later, he learned his youngest child, in preschool, had begun building the twin
towers out of blocks and knocking them down, and having nightmares that the same thing would
happen to his home. "Even at his age, he was bothered by it."</p>

<p><b>John Lim</b></p>
<p><b>Then:</b> Detective in Brooklyn</p>
<p><b>Now:</b> Gold Coast School police officer</p>
<p>Lim remembers digging with his hands through piles of glass, Rebar, chunks of concrete and
the occasional piece of mangled furniture, for hours. It wasn't until late in the day on Sept. 12
that his area started getting buckets to help with the digging. The only time work would cease
would be when someone would call for silence in hopes of hearing the calls of a survivor, or
when a siren blast signaled that a structure was in danger of falling.</p>

<p><b>Hans Austin</b></p>
<p><b>Then:</b> On missing-person squad</p>
<p><b>Now:</b> Village Academy school police officer</p>
<p>Walking near the north tower, Austin heard an explosion, but he had no idea that the south
tower was collapsing. Nor did he realize at first that the "puff! puff!" sounds he heard were the
bodies of people who had jumped from windows exploding on the pavement nearby.</p>
