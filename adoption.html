     <p>Five-year-old Kayla lost her first tooth last week.</p>
      <p>She proudly points to the small gap in her mouth and says that, this Thanksgiving, she’s thankful for losing that tooth and for the tooth fairy. </p>
      <p>It’s a simple thing, that. The wonderful innocence of a child whose biggest preoccupation is how much money she got from the tooth fairy.</p>
      <p>But for Kayla and her Boynton Beach family, it’s no small thing.</p>
      <p>Only a few months before, Kayla and her 12-year-old sister Stephanie, had been living in foster
      homes and searching for a family and some normalcy.</p>
      <p>Only a few months before, parents Amy and Ken had been wishing for children of their own.</p>
      <p>Finally, last Friday, the girls found a permanent home, and Amy and Ken became adoptive
      parents.</p>
      <p>Today, the four of them will sit down to their first Thanksgiving meal together and be grateful
      for small things: Tooth fairies. Story times. Sparkly star-shaped hair clips. Family.</p>
      <p>. . .</p>
      <p>Stephanie’s biological mother was 14 when she gave birth to Stephanie. Stephanie’s father was
      27 and had a habit of hitting Stephanie’s mother. Both parents had a problem with drugs.</p>
      <p>Stephanie learned to fear her biological father. She still does; it’s the reason the family asked that last names not be used in this story. </p>
      <p>She missed out on some of those normal childhood things, while busy acting as a parent and
      protector to her own mother.</p>
      <p>When Stephanie lost her first tooth, the tooth fairy never showed up. She kept thinking the tooth fairy had forgotten her; she kept placing every successive tooth under her pillow, to no avail.</p>
      <p>Finally, someone told her that the tooth fairy didn’t exist.</p>
      <p>Little sister Kayla came along seven years after Stephanie. But problems in the home continued
      to escalate. Kayla was only 6 months old when the two girls were removed and placed in foster
      care.</p>
      <p>For the next several years, the girls moved around to four or five different foster homes, always looking for a family that might take them in.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Amy and Ken were searching for a child to complete their family.</p>
      <p>The couple got married three years ago and had been trying to have children.</p>
      <p>In the back of their minds, they’d always considered adoption. Ken’s mother was adopted and he
      said he “always thought I’d return the favor and do the same.”</p>
      <p>They were prompted to take the first steps toward becoming adoptive parents when they saw a
      haunting photo of a little boy in the Heart Gallery while shopping at the Boynton Beach Mall.</p>
      <p>The Heart Gallery is a traveling photo exhibit created by the Children’s Home Society of Florida that showcases children in need of adoption.</p>
      <p>In January, they began taking classes, finishing in April. They decided to take a break from the exhaustive process about that time.</p>
      <p>“To read the home studies, it’s heartbreaking,” Amy said. Plus, Ken had to leave town for a
      business trip.</p>
      <p>But that same month, the couple’s adoption specialist called, saying there were a pair of sisters that might be a good fit. Could they take a look?</p>
      <p>“We opened the email and clicked on the pictures,” Amy said. “We said, ‘Those are our girls.’ ”</p>
      <p>From there, it was an uncharacteristic whirlwind.</p>
      <p>The girls’ foster mother was leaving soon for an extended out-of-town trip, and workers wanted
      to place the girls in a permanent home instead of shuffling them off to another foster home while
      the adoption process continued.</p>
      <p>On July 19, Amy and Ken went to Boomers in Boca Raton to meet the girls for the first time.</p>
      <p>“It was as nerve-wracking as my first date with him,” Amy said, nodding at Ken. “When you’re
      about to meet your kids for the first time, it’s overwhelming. ... Boomers was my delivery
      room.”</p>
      <p>It was awkward at first. Of course. But soon Stephanie and Ken were playing air hockey together
      — Stephanie won — and the four of them were beginning to bond.</p>
      <p>About an hour into the meeting, Kayla asked the caseworker if she could give Ken a hug.</p>
      <p>“She jumped in his arms and said she’d been waiting for this forever,” Amy said, tearing up.
      “She had never known a father.”</p>
      <p>After the meeting, Amy and Ken went back to their car and just sat in the Boomers parking lot.</p>
      <p>“To be faced with two little people who are going to be in your life forever more, it’s beyond
      description,” Ken said.</p>
      <p>In the weeks that followed, there were more meetings. Amy had the girls over for dinner —
      fettuccine alfredo, Stephanie’s favorite. (Kayla’s favorite, rice with ketchup, has not yet made it onto the menu, although one of her other favorites, macaroni and cheese, has.)</p>
      <p>“I wanted it to be the best meal ever,” Amy said, admitting that she never liked fettuccine alfredo and had never made it before.</p>
      <p>Then there was a sleepover soon after that.</p>
      <p>“The first time I tucked them in, I cried,” Amy said. “I felt like I’d missed all those nights of tucking them in.”</p>
      <p>. . .</p>
      <p>The girls officially moved in Aug. 9. Amy calls that day “famiversary day.”</p>
      <p>Amy served fettuccine alfredo again Friday. It seems to have become one of the family’s
      celebratory meals.</p>
      <p>That day a judge signed off on Amy, Ken, Stephanie and Kayla all officially becoming a family.</p>
      <p>“This was meant to be for a long time,” said Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge Don
      Hafele, who had seen Stephanie and Kayla in his courtroom several times before.</p>
      <p>The girls had picked out their outfits for the adoption day two months in advance, excited at the prospect of it all.</p>
      <p>They had their adoption as part of the county’s National Adoption Day celebrations, participating in a slew of special activities at the Palm Beach County courthouse before going in front of Hafele to get the adoption finalized.</p>
      <p>Kayla wandered the halls in a blue and white polka dot dress, her mouth red from eating candies.</p>
      <p>Stephanie, overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle, fell silent, taking pictures of everything with her smartphone.</p>
      <p>Stephanie is often shy at first, but it’s clear she’s comfortable and happy with her new family.</p>
      <p>Through her mother, she said she is thankful for having a home and wants others to also consider adopting children.</p>
      <p>Kayla is more spunky and outgoing than her older sister, openly sharing her affections.</p>
      <p>She throws her arms around Ken, hanging from his neck, touching Amy’s cheek.</p>
      <p>She talks about how the couple is hers “forever now” and says that family means “when we get
      to be together for 1,000 years.”</p>
      <p>After all of the excitement of finalizing the adoption, the family is eager to just have some time together this Thanksgiving break, to just be a family. </p>
      <p>“This is the best Thanksgiving of them all,” Ken said, hugging Kayla.</p>
      <p>It’s the best Thanksgiving for lots of small reasons.</p>
      <p>For macaroni and cheese on the Thanksgiving table. For the chaos of dinner and bath time. For someone to love unconditionally and to be loved back.</p>
      <p>For fettuccine alfredo and missing teeth.</p>
